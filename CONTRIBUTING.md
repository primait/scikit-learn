Contributing to primakit-learn
============================

The latest contributing guide is available in the repository at
`doc/developers/contributing.rst`, or online at:

https://primakit-learn.org/dev/developers/contributing.html

There are many ways to contribute to primakit-learn, with the most common ones
being contribution of code or documentation to the project. Improving the
documentation is no less important than improving the library itself. If you
find a typo in the documentation, or have made improvements, do not hesitate to
send an email to the mailing list or preferably submit a GitHub pull request.
Documentation can be found under the
[doc/](https://github.com/primakit-learn/primakit-learn/tree/main/doc) directory.

But there are many other ways to help. In particular answering queries on the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/primakit-learn/primakit-learn/issues),
investigating bugs, and [reviewing other developers' pull
requests](http://primakit-learn.org/dev/developers/contributing.html#code-review-guidelines)
are very valuable contributions that decrease the burden on the project
maintainers.

Another way to contribute is to report issues you're facing, and give a "thumbs
up" on issues that others reported and that are relevant to you. It also helps
us if you spread the word: reference the project from your blog and articles,
link to it from your website, or simply star it in GitHub to say "I use it".
